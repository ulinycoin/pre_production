  <p>
    LocalPDF is a privacy-first PDF toolkit designed for users who value security, speed, and simplicity.
    Unlike traditional online PDF tools that upload your documents to remote servers, LocalPDF processes
    everything locally in your browser.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    We believe that working with PDFs shouldn't require sacrificing your privacy. Every day, millions of
    people upload sensitive documents—contracts, invoices, medical records, tax forms—to cloud-based PDF
    services without knowing where their files go or who has access to them.
  </p>

  <p><strong>LocalPDF changes that.</strong></p>

  <p>
    By leveraging modern web technologies (WebAssembly, PDF.js, pdf-lib), we've built a complete PDF toolkit
    that runs entirely in your browser. Your files never leave your device. No uploads, no tracking, no data collection.
  </p>

  <h2>Why We Built This</h2>

  <div class="card-grid">
          <div class="tech-card">
            <h4>Privacy by Design</h4>
            <p>We believe your documents belong to you. LocalPDF is built on the philosophy that processing should happen as 
               close to the user as possible. Read our 
               <a href="/learn/private-pdf-processing-guide" style="color: #60A5FA; font-weight: 600;">Definitive Guide to Private PDF Processing</a> 
               to learn more about our technology.

          </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Privacy Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Your documents contain sensitive information. They shouldn't be uploaded to servers you don't control,
        scanned by algorithms you don't understand, or stored in databases you can't delete.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Speed Wins</h3>
      <p>
        Uploading large PDFs to servers is slow. Processing in your browser is instant—no network delays,
        no queues, no waiting. Just pure, native performance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Simplicity First</h3>
      <p>
        Transparent pricing, local processing, and no hidden trackers.
        The way software should work.
      </p>
    </div>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    LocalPDF uses client-side JavaScript libraries to manipulate PDFs directly in your browser:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>pdf-lib</strong> — For merging, splitting, compressing, and protecting PDFs</li>
    <li><strong>PDF.js</strong> — Mozilla's open-source PDF renderer for previews and OCR</li>
    <li><strong>Tesseract.js</strong> — OCR engine that extracts text from scanned documents</li>
    <li><strong>React 19</strong> — Modern UI framework for smooth interactions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When you upload a file, it stays in your browser's memory. Processing happens using WebAssembly and
    JavaScript—no network requests, no server communication. When you download the result, the file is
    generated locally and saved to your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Open Source &amp; Transparent</h2>
  <p>
    LocalPDF is built on open-source technologies. We believe in transparency and community-driven development.
    Our codebase uses battle-tested libraries trusted by millions of developers worldwide.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    <strong>Privacy Sanctuary:</strong> LocalPDF processes everything in your browser.
    We value your privacy and keep our tools transparent and secure.
  </div>

  <h2>Our Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> Your files never leave your device. Period.</li>
    <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> No cookies, no analytics, no user profiling.</li>
    <li><strong>Security First:</strong> State-of-the-art encryption and local processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Instant processing with no upload delays.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>
  <p>
    LocalPDF is inherently GDPR-compliant because we don't process, store, or transfer personal data:
  </p>

  <div class="card-grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Zero Data Collection</h3>
      <p>
        We don't collect, process, or store any personal data. No cookies, no tracking scripts, no analytics.
        Your files are processed entirely in your browser's memory and deleted when you close the tab.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>No Data Controllers</h3>
      <p>
        Under GDPR, a "data controller" determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.
        Since LocalPDF never receives your data, we're not a data controller—there's nothing to control.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Right to Erasure? Automatic.</h3>
      <p>
        GDPR grants you the "right to be forgotten." With LocalPDF, your data is automatically erased
        from browser memory the moment you close the tab. No manual deletion requests needed.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="info-box">
    <strong>For EU Users:</strong> LocalPDF fully respects your rights under GDPR (Regulation EU 2016/679).
    Since all processing happens locally in your browser with zero server communication, your documents
    never cross borders, never enter databases, and never require consent forms. Read our full
    <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for details.
